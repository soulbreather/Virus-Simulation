# Virus Simulation
![COVID-19](/images/CoronaVirus.png)
#### We have made a program that is trying to simulate a virus being transferred depending on how close you are to the person who is infected with the virus. The program was created by Samuel E.G.S. & Thomas A.S. using mostly P5.js and bootstrap to make the site look nice.

## How to open/use the program
**Online:**
You can access the simulation online using this awesome button [![Click Me](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://soulbreather.github.io/Virus-Simulation/src/index.html)

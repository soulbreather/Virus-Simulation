# Virus Simulation
![COVID-19](/images/CoronaVirus.png)
#### We have made a program that is trying to simulate a virus being transferred depending on how close you are to the person who is infected with the virus. The program was created by Samuel E.G.S. & Thomas A.S. using mostly P5.js and bootstrap to make the site look nice.

## How to open/use the program
**Online:**
You can access the simulation online using this link [![Click Me](/images/ClickMe.png)](https://soulbreather.github.io/Virus-Simulation/src/index.html)

**Locally:**
The repository can also be cloned and runned from your desktop. Just simply run this command in your terminal:
    git clone https://github.com/soulbreather/VirusSimulation.git
Or alternatively install it with this [link](https://github.com/soulbreather/VirusSimulation.git).

## TODO List
- [x] Create People class
- [x] Create sliders for adjusting the simulation
- [x] Make nice bootstrap 4 design
- [ ] Create tooltips
- [ ] Add graph
- [ ] Create advanced tab
- [ ] Create isolation option
- [ ] Create movement type option
- [ ] Make self adjustable max values for various sliders needing it. Fx infected slider max value sould be the same as amount of people
